# CIF_Tester

How exactly this cif tester works
  You just need to update the CIF, labels and their type in the code and then run it.

  When it gets executed, before starting the conversation you have to select the cif from the dropdown list and pass it the value that you would like to     test.
  
  The value gets set and you can start the conversation and test the flow by passing different values to the cif tester depending on various use case.
